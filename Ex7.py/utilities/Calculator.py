#**Assignment 4: Defining Functions in Python**
#Define and use functions in Python to perform specific tasks.
#**Instructions:**

#1. Create a new Python file named `calculator.py`.

#2. Define a function named `add` that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
def add (X ,Y) : 
    return X+Y

#3. Define a function named `subtract` that takes two arguments and returns their difference.
def subtarct (X, Y) :
    return X-Y

#4. Define a function named `multiply` that takes two arguments and returns their product.
def multiply (X ,Y) :
    return X*Y

#5. Define a function named `divide` that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.
def divide (X, Y) :
    return X/Y

#6. Write a main block that calls each function with sample inputs and prints the results.
X = 5
Y = 10

print("X + Y = ",add(X, Y))
print("X - Y = ",subtarct(X, Y))
print("X * Y = ",multiply(X, Y))
print("X / 5Y = ",divide(X, Y))
