#**Assignment 8: Filtering and Modifying a List of Student Grades**
#Imagine you have a list of student grades and you need to create a list of students who have passed (with grades 60 and above) and give a 5% bonus to those grades.
#**Instruction**:
#1. Define a list of integers named `grades` containing student grades.
grades = [55, 70, 65, 40, 90, 85, 50, 77]

#2. Use a list comprehension to create a new list named `passed_with_bonus` that:
    #- Filters the grades to include only those that are 60 and above.
    # - Applies a 5% bonus to each of the filtered grades.
pass_with_bonus = list(map(lambda grade: grade*1.05 , filter(lambda grade: grade>= 60 , grades)))

#3. Print the `passed_with_bonus` list to display the modified grades.
#Expected Output:
#Grades after filtering and applying bonus: [73.5, 68.25, 94.5, 89.25, 80.85]4
print("Grades after filtering and applying bonus:", pass_with_bonus)
